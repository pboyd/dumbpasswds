# Dumb Password Storage

This repo contains several ways to save passwords to a database. Most of them
are dumb.

This code is the basis for a blog post: [How Not To Store Passwords](https://pboyd.io/posts/how-not-to-store-passwords/). Much of which was re-used on an [educative.io course](https://www.educative.io/courses/how-not-to-store-passwords).

To run the app, [install Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and run `docker-compose up`.
